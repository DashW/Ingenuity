- Scripting abstraction for Lua
- Image processing abstraction for FreeImage and WIC
- File IO abstraction for Win32 and Windows::Storage APIs
- A robust metadata system for precompiled shaders
- A simple, asynchronous asset loading & management system
- An experimental vector graphics library with SVG parser & path triangulator
Planned features include:
Physics, Multithreading, Runtime Libraries, OpenGL, Geometry Shaders, Frustum Culling & Picking

Ingenuity Game Engine is a scripting frontend for the Ingenuity Framework, intended for rapid development without sacrificing quality. Features include development on target platform, script reloading, and a basic console.
