Ingenuity Game Engine and Real-Time Applicaiton Framework

Ingenuity Framework is a lightweight collection of C++ libraries and API wrappers for the development of realtime, hardware-accelerated applications such as games, visualisations and tools. Current features include:
- Entrypoints for Win32 and Windows Store applications
- GPU abstraction for DirectX11, OpenGL (experimental), and DirectX9 (deprecated)
- Audio abstraction for XAudio2
- Scripting abstraction for Lua
- Image processing abstraction for FreeImage and WIC
- File IO abstraction for Win32 and Windows::Storage APIs
- Physics abstraction for Newton Game Dynamics
- A robust metadata system for precompiled shaders
- A simple, asynchronous asset loading & management system
- An experimental vector graphics library with SVG parser & path triangulator

Planned features include:
Frustum & Occlusion Culling, Runtime Libraries, Multithreading, Networking, and better support for more asset formats (OGG, COLLADA)

Ingenuity Game Engine is a scripting frontend for the Ingenuity Framework, intended for rapid development without sacrificing quality. Features include development on target platform, runtime script reloading, and a basic console.
